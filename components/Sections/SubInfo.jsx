            Hi! my name is Joma,{" "}
          </span>{" "}
          I design and build web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first half of 2021, I started the Web Development path. I like
          the fact that I can take simple ideas, apply my thought process, then
          design a mockup; I am able to turn them into real-world applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          These days, on top of revisiting my old projects and refreshing with
          the foundations, I keep myself occupied by learning new things â€”
          especially those related to digital content creation. I am also in the
          process of collaborating with a developer I know who is in the same
          field as I am. When I'm not working, I usually spend time watching
          videos or hanging out with my friends every other time.
